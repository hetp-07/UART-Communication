# UART Communication Library for Arduino

This repository contains a simple UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication library for Arduino. It enables easy interfacing with UART devices such as sensors or other microcontrollers.

## Files

- **uart.h**: Header file containing the declaration of the UART class.
- **uart.cpp**: Source file implementing the methods of the UART class.
- **example.ino**: Example Arduino sketch demonstrating the usage of the UART library with a sensor.

## Usage

1. **Clone or download** this repository into your Arduino project directory.
2. **Include the `uart.h`** file in your Arduino sketch.
3. **Instantiate the `UART` class** with the desired baud rate using the constructor.
4. **Use the provided methods** (**`begin`**, **`println`**, **`echoBack`**, **`printdataln`**) to interact with UART devices.

## Note

- Ensure that you have included the necessary libraries, such as **Arduino.h**, in your Arduino sketch.
- Modify the example code according to your specific sensor or UART device.
