#UART Communication Library for Arduino


This repository contains a simple UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication library for Arduino. It enables easy interfacing with UART devices such as sensors or other microcontrollers.

Files
uart.h: Header file containing the declaration of the UART class.
uart.cpp: Source file implementing the methods of the UART class.
example.ino: Example Arduino sketch demonstrating the usage of the UART library with a sensor.
Usage
Clone or download this repository into your Arduino project directory.
Include the uart.h file in your Arduino sketch.
Instantiate the UART class with the desired baud rate using the constructor.
Use the provided methods (begin, println, echoBack, printdataln) to interact with UART devices.
